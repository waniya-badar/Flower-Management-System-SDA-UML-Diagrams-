# Flower-Management-System-SDA-UML-Diagrams-
The Flower Management System (FMS) is a full-stack web application developed as part of a university project. It leverages strong software engineering practices including requirements gathering, modular architecture, and Unified Modeling Language (UML) diagrams for system design and documentation.

This project adheres to the IEEE Standard for Software Requirements Specification and follows an Agile development model with sprint-based iterations.

The system follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern to ensure separation of concerns, scalability, and maintainability.

### UML Design Artifacts:
Use Case Diagram – Highlights user roles and system functionalities

Class Diagram – Depicts system classes and their relationships

Activity Diagram – Models workflows like placing an order or managing inventory

Sequence Diagrams – Show interaction flows for major use cases

State Diagram – Represents system state transitions (e.g., order lifecycle)

Component Diagram – Visualizes the logical components and their interactions

Deployment Diagram – Describes the deployment architecture

Collaboration Diagram – Explains object collaborations in runtime scenarios

Entity-Control-Boundary (ECB) Diagram – Supports clean architecture design
